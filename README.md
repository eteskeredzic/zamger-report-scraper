# zamger report scraper

A small R script for fetching zamger (https://zamger.etf.unsa.ba/) reports and returning them as dataframes (optionally also saving them as .csv file). Since zamger doesn't have a proper API for fetching these reports, web scraping must be done - this script does exactly that. The purpose is to provide an easy way for collecting course data from zamger, in order to use that data in various statistical analyses.
